# Feature Specification: Database Migration and Synchronization System

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-need-to`
**Created**: 2025-09-26
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I need to use the methods in this code base to migrate new database tables and rows from the source database represented in the @.env file to the destination supabase database on this machine. We need to determine if the sets of scripts used to do the original migration can be used or altered to update the current target database with all the rows from the source that the target does not have. once that is done, and we validate it works, we must come up with a way to keep the two databases in sync"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-26
- Q: How often should the system synchronize data between source and target databases? ‚Üí A: Scheduled intervals (e.g., hourly, daily batches)
- Q: When the system encounters records that exist in both source and target databases but have different values, how should conflicts be resolved? ‚Üí A: Source wins (always overwrite target with source data)
- Q: What is the expected maximum data volume the synchronization system should support per sync operation? ‚Üí A: Medium (10K-100K records per sync)
- Q: What level of monitoring and alerting should the synchronization system provide? ‚Üí A: Basic logs only (file-based logging for debugging)
- Q: How should the system handle records that have been deleted from the source database but still exist in the target database? ‚Üí A: Mirror deletions (delete matching records from target)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a database administrator, I need to ensure that my target Supabase database contains all the data from my source database, including any new records that have been added since the original migration, and I need an ongoing mechanism to keep both databases synchronized to prevent data drift.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an existing target database with previously migrated data and a source database with additional new records, **When** I run the differential migration process, **Then** all new records from the source database are successfully migrated to the target database without duplicating existing records
2. **Given** a completed differential migration, **When** I run the validation process, **Then** the system confirms that all source database records exist in the target database and reports any discrepancies
3. **Given** ongoing database operations, **When** new data is added to the source database, **Then** the synchronization system detects and migrates these changes to the target database during the next scheduled sync interval
4. **Given** a synchronization failure, **When** the system encounters an error, **Then** detailed error logs are provided and the system can resume from the last successful checkpoint

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the source database contains records that conflict with existing target database records? (Resolved: source data overwrites target data)
- How does the system handle schema changes in the source database that don't exist in the target?
- What occurs when the synchronization process is interrupted mid-migration?
- How are deleted records in the source database handled in the target database? (Resolved: mirror deletions - remove from target when deleted from source)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST analyze existing migration scripts to determine their reusability for differential migration
- **FR-002**: System MUST identify all new records in the source database that don't exist in the target database
- **FR-003**: System MUST migrate only new/missing records from source to target database without duplicating existing data
- **FR-004**: System MUST preserve all existing data relationships and integrity constraints during differential migration
- **FR-005**: System MUST validate that all source database records exist in the target database after migration
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide detailed migration reports showing success rates, failures, and data counts
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain audit trails for all migration and synchronization operations
- **FR-008**: System MUST implement ongoing synchronization to detect and migrate new source database changes
- **FR-015**: System MUST mirror deletions by removing records from target database when they are deleted from source database
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle migration failures gracefully with rollback capabilities
- **FR-010**: System MUST preserve existing UUID mappings and legacy ID relationships from original migration
- **FR-011**: Synchronization process MUST run on scheduled intervals with configurable frequency (hourly, daily, or custom)
- **FR-012**: System MUST handle conflicts by prioritizing source database data when source and target records differ (source wins strategy)
- **FR-013**: System MUST support processing up to 100,000 records per synchronization operation with batch processing for optimal performance
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide comprehensive file-based logging for debugging and operational tracking of synchronization status

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Migration Checkpoint**: Represents the state of migration progress, including last processed record, timestamp, and status
- **Data Differential**: Represents the comparison between source and target databases, identifying missing or changed records
- **Synchronization Job**: Represents an ongoing sync operation with scheduling, status, and error handling
- **Migration Validation Report**: Represents the results of data integrity checks between source and target databases
- **Legacy ID Mapping**: Represents the relationship between original integer IDs and new UUID primary keys from the existing migration system
