# Research: Database Migration and Synchronization System

## Existing Infrastructure Analysis

### Current Migration Architecture
**Decision**: Leverage existing TypeScript migration infrastructure with pg client and batch processing patterns
**Rationale**:
- Proven success with 1.2M+ records migrated at 98.5%+ success rate
- Established patterns for database connections, UUID mapping, and error handling
- Existing `migration_control` and `migration_mappings` tables provide audit trails
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Building from scratch (rejected - unnecessary complexity and risk)
- External ETL tools (rejected - doesn't integrate with existing UUID mapping system)

### Database Connection Patterns
**Decision**: Reuse existing dual-database connection pattern with pg Pool instances
**Rationale**:
- Successfully handles source (legacy PostgreSQL) and target (Supabase) connections
- Proven environment variable configuration with `.env` support
- Built-in connection pooling and error handling
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Direct Supabase client only (rejected - need raw SQL for complex differential queries)
- ORM solutions (rejected - existing codebase is raw SQL focused)

### Batch Processing Strategy
**Decision**: Extend existing batch processing with BATCH_SIZE=500 pattern for differential operations
**Rationale**:
- Current system processes 100K+ records efficiently in batches
- Memory-efficient for large dataset comparisons
- Checkpoint/resume capability already implemented
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Stream processing (rejected - adds complexity without clear benefit)
- Single-transaction processing (rejected - doesn't scale for 100K records)

## Differential Migration Research

### Data Comparison Approach
**Decision**: Use LEFT JOIN queries with legacy_id metadata fields for identifying missing records
**Rationale**:
- Existing migration preserves legacy IDs in metadata JSON fields
- SQL-based comparison is efficient for large datasets
- Leverages database engine optimization for set operations
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Application-level comparison (rejected - memory intensive for 100K records)
- Timestamp-based detection (rejected - no reliable modification timestamps in source)

### Conflict Resolution Strategy
**Decision**: Implement "source wins" with field-level comparison and selective updates
**Rationale**:
- Clear business rule established during clarification
- Minimizes data loss risk
- Consistent with clarified requirements
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Target preservation (rejected - doesn't meet sync requirements)
- Manual review (rejected - doesn't scale for automated synchronization)

## Synchronization Scheduling Research

### Scheduling Implementation
**Decision**: Use Node.js cron-like scheduling with configurable intervals stored in environment variables
**Rationale**:
- Integrates with existing TypeScript infrastructure
- Simple configuration via .env files
- No external dependencies required
**Alternatives Considered**:
- System cron jobs (rejected - harder to manage and log)
- External scheduling services (rejected - adds deployment complexity)

### State Management
**Decision**: Extend existing `migration_control` table with sync job tracking
**Rationale**:
- Proven audit trail and checkpoint system
- Consistent with existing migration patterns
- Supports resume capability after failures
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Separate sync state tables (rejected - fragmenting audit trail)
- In-memory state only (rejected - doesn't survive restarts)

## Performance and Scalability

### Query Optimization
**Decision**: Use database indexes on legacy_id metadata fields and creation timestamps
**Rationale**:
- Differential queries depend on efficient legacy ID lookups
- Large dataset queries require proper indexing
- JSON field indexing supported in PostgreSQL
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Full table scans (rejected - doesn't scale to 100K+ records)
- External search engines (rejected - over-engineering for this use case)

### Memory Management
**Decision**: Stream-based processing with fixed batch sizes and connection pooling
**Rationale**:
- Prevents memory bloat during large synchronization operations
- Proven pattern in existing migration system
- Graceful handling of connection limits
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Load all data into memory (rejected - doesn't scale)
- Single-record processing (rejected - too slow for large datasets)

## Error Handling and Logging

### Logging Strategy
**Decision**: Extend existing file-based logging with structured JSON format for sync operations
**Rationale**:
- Meets clarified requirement for basic file-based logging
- Consistent with existing migration log patterns
- Structured format enables future analysis
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Console-only logging (rejected - doesn't persist for troubleshooting)
- External logging services (rejected - exceeds basic logging requirement)

### Recovery Patterns
**Decision**: Implement checkpoint-based recovery with transaction rollback on batch failures
**Rationale**:
- Proven pattern in existing migration system
- Ensures data consistency during sync operations
- Enables resume from last successful point
**Alternatives Considered**:
- All-or-nothing transactions (rejected - risk losing partial progress)
- No recovery (rejected - doesn't meet reliability requirements)

## Integration Points

### Migration Script Reusability
**Decision**: Create wrapper functions that reuse existing migration logic for new record processing
**Rationale**:
- Maintains consistency with existing data transformation rules
- Reduces code duplication and maintenance burden
- Leverages proven validation and error handling
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Duplicate migration logic (rejected - maintenance nightmare)
- Generic processing (rejected - loses domain-specific validation)

### UUID Mapping Preservation
**Decision**: Ensure all new differential migrations maintain existing UUID mapping patterns
**Rationale**:
- Critical for referential integrity across 1.2M+ existing records
- Consistent with established migration architecture
- Required for backward compatibility
**Alternatives Considered**:
- New UUID generation (rejected - breaks existing relationships)
- Mixed ID systems (rejected - creates inconsistency)

## Validation and Testing

### Validation Strategy
**Decision**: Extend existing validation scripts with differential-specific checks
**Rationale**:
- Proven validation patterns for data integrity checks
- Consistent CLI interface via npm run commands
- Comprehensive reporting already established
**Alternatives Considered**:
- New validation framework (rejected - breaks established patterns)
- Manual validation only (rejected - doesn't scale)

### Testing Approach
**Decision**: Integration tests focusing on end-to-end sync scenarios with existing database fixtures
**Rationale**:
- Matches existing testing approach for migration scripts
- Validates against real data patterns and edge cases
- Ensures compatibility with existing system
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Unit tests only (rejected - misses integration issues)
- Production testing (rejected - too risky for data integrity)
