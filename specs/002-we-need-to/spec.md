# Comprehensive Migration Scripts Coverage Specification

**Feature Branch**: `002-we-need-to`
**Created**: 2025-09-26
**Status**: Complete Coverage Analysis
**Input**: User description: "we need to account for ALL the scripts that have been run in this repository that include clinical data, business data, communications, data, etc."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → User requests comprehensive coverage of ALL migration scripts
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Actors: Database administrators, migration engineers
   → Actions: Account for, catalog, ensure coverage
   → Data: Clinical data, business data, communications data
   → Constraints: Must include ALL scripts, no data left behind
3. Catalog all migration scripts in repository
   → Systematic analysis of 40+ migration files
4. Categorize by data types and business domains
   → Clinical, Business, Communications, Technical, etc.
5. Validate migration coverage completeness
   → Ensure no gaps in data synchronization
6. Document execution status and success metrics
   → 99%+ success rates across all categories
```

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a database administrator executing a comprehensive migration, I need to ensure that ALL data from the legacy system is properly migrated to the target system, including clinical records, business operations data, and communications, so that no information is lost during the transition.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a legacy database with clinical data, **When** migration scripts are executed, **Then** all patient records, treatments, and medical history must be preserved in the target system
2. **Given** business operational data in the source system, **When** migration completes, **Then** all financial records, office data, and operational workflows must be functional in the target
3. **Given** communications and messaging data, **When** synchronization occurs, **Then** all message threads, comments, and notifications must maintain continuity

### Edge Cases
- What happens when source schema differs from expected structure?
- How does system handle partial migration failures with recovery?
- What occurs when foreign key relationships are broken during migration?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST migrate all clinical data including patient profiles, medical history, treatments, and orders with 99%+ success rate
- **FR-002**: System MUST preserve all business data including offices, payments, billing, and financial records with zero data corruption
- **FR-003**: System MUST synchronize all communications data including messages, comments, notifications, and feedback systems
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain complete audit trail via migration_mappings table for all legacy ID to UUID conversions
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide rollback capability for all migration operations to ensure data safety
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate data integrity after each migration phase with comprehensive reporting
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle schema mismatches and constraint violations with automated resolution
- **FR-008**: System MUST process large datasets using optimized batch processing (500-2000 records per batch)
