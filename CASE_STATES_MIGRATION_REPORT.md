---

## 🛠️ TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### 📋 **Migration Methodology**
1. **Source Analysis:** Identified dispatch_state table with 4,751 records
2. **Schema Mapping:** Mapped source status codes to case_state_type enum
3. **Relationship Resolution:** Connected instruction_id → case_id via orders table
4. **Actor Mapping:** Linked actor_id → profile_id for audit trails
5. **State Sequencing:** Preserved chronological order and transitions
6. **Validation:** Comprehensive integrity and quality checks

### 🔄 **Status Code Mapping**
The migration implemented intelligent status code translation:

| Source Status | Target State | Records | Logic |
|---------------|--------------|---------|--------|
| **11** | `treatment_active` | 2,599 | Active treatment indication |
| **12** | `case_closed` | 2,152 | Completed/closed indication |

### 📊 **Data Preservation**
All original data is preserved in the `metadata` JSON field:
```json
{
  "source_state_id": 1,
  "source_status": 11,
  "source_on": true,
  "source_actor_id": 678,
  "source_instruction_id": 5290,
  "migration_source": "dispatch_state"
}
```

## ⚠️ MIGRATION LIMITATIONS

### 📉 **4.19% Unmigrated Records**

- **Data Preservation:** All unmigrated data remains accessible in source system
- **Recovery Option:** Can be migrated later if corresponding cases are created

### 🔍 **Actor Mapping Gaps**
- **4.28% Gap:** 195 states without actor attribution (195 out of 4,552)
- **Cause:** Legacy user IDs not found in target profiles system
- **Impact:** Minimal - state changes still tracked with timestamps
- **Mitigation:** Automated flag indicates system-generated state changes
