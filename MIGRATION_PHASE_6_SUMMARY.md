## 🚫 Tables Not Migrated (Complex Mapping Required)

| Source Table | Target Table | Volume | Reason |
|-------------|--------------|--------|--------|
| `dispatch_payment` | `payments` | 16,014 records | Requires order_id mapping and schema adaptation |
| `dispatch_operation` | `operations` | 3,522 records | Payment operations, not medical operations |
| `dispatch_notification` | `notifications` | 5,102,536 records | Large volume, requires user/profile mapping |
| `dispatch_template_products` | `template_products` | 166 records | Requires product mapping |
| `dispatch_template_view_groups` | `template_view_groups` | 183 records | Requires auth_group mapping |

**Total unmigrated records:** 5,122,421 (requires specialized migration approaches)

## 🏗️ Migration Phases Completed

1. **Phase 6.1** ✅ - Created missing target tables and indexes
2. **Phase 6.2** ✅ - Migrated reference data (roles, ware, storages)  
3. **Phase 6.3** ⚠️ - Transactional data (partially completed, complex tables deferred)
4. **Phase 6.4** ✅ - Template hierarchy migration
5. **Phase 6.5** ✅ - Comprehensive validation (all integrity checks passed)
6. **Phase 6.6** ✅ - Final cleanup and logging

---

## 🔍 Data Integrity Validation Results

- **Foreign Key Integrity:** ✅ PASS - No orphaned records
- **Legacy ID Coverage:** ✅ 100% for roles and templates
- **Referential Consistency:** ✅ All relationships properly maintained
- **Data Completeness:** ✅ All targeted records successfully migrated

---

## 📋 Next Steps / Recommendations

1. **Complex Table Migration:** The unmigrated tables require specialized approaches:
   - `dispatch_notification`: Implement batch processing with user mapping
   - `dispatch_payment`: Create order_id lookup mechanism
   - `dispatch_operation`: Clarify if payment operations should map to medical operations
   - `dispatch_template_products`: Establish product mapping table
   - `dispatch_template_view_groups`: Implement group permission system

2. **Performance Optimization:** Consider adding additional indexes on frequently queried legacy_id columns

3. **Data Archival:** Original source data can be archived as migration is complete for covered tables
