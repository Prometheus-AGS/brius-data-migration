-- =====================================================
-- SAFE REMOVAL OF CLINICAL_COMMUNICATIONS TABLE
-- =====================================================
-- 
-- ANALYSIS SUMMARY:
-- ‚úÖ Table is completely empty (0 records, never used)
-- ‚ùå Referenced by public.v_all_communications view
-- ‚ùå Has audit triggers that need to be handled
-- ‚ùå Has foreign key constraints (RI triggers)
-- ‚úÖ No tables reference it as foreign key
-- ‚úÖ No custom functions reference it
--
-- REMOVAL PLAN:
-- 1. Update/replace public.v_all_communications view
-- 2. Drop the table (will automatically drop triggers and constraints)
-- =====================================================

BEGIN;

-- Step 1: Replace the old public.v_all_communications view
-- This view currently references clinical_communications but we want to 
-- replace it with our new sem.v_all_communications
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS public.v_all_communications CASCADE;

-- Create a replacement that points to our new semantic layer
CREATE VIEW public.v_all_communications AS

COMMENT ON VIEW public.v_all_communications IS 'Legacy compatibility view - redirects to sem.v_all_communications. Provides backward compatibility for existing code that references the old unified communications view.';

-- Step 2: Verify the old view is replaced
\echo 'Step 1 completed: Replaced public.v_all_communications view'

-- Step 3: Drop the clinical_communications table
-- This will automatically drop:
-- - All triggers (including audit triggers)  
-- - All constraints (including foreign keys)
-- - All indexes
-- - All permissions are revoked automatically
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS public.clinical_communications CASCADE;

\echo 'Step 2 completed: Dropped clinical_communications table with CASCADE'

-- Step 4: Clean up any orphaned audit log entries (if audit system exists)
-- Note: This is optional and depends on your audit system implementation
