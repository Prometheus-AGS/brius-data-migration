## 🔄 ONGOING SYNCHRONIZATION STRATEGY

### Challenge Assessment
**Current State:** Static migration (point-in-time transfer)
**Business Need:** Ongoing data synchronization from active source system
**Complexity:** High due to UUID transformation requirements

### Option 1: 📅 **DAILY SYNCHRONIZATION**

#### Implementation Approach
- **Schedule:** Every day at 2:00 AM (low-traffic period)
- **Method:** Incremental sync based on `updated_at` timestamps
- **Architecture:** Delta detection → Batch processing → UUID mapping

#### Technical Implementation
```typescript
// Daily sync scheduler
interface DailySyncConfig {
  schedule: "0 2 * * *" // 2 AM daily
  batchSize: 1000
  timeoutMs: 3600000 // 1 hour max
  retryAttempts: 3
}
```

#### ✅ **POSITIVES**
- **Near Real-time Data:** 24-hour maximum latency
- **Business Continuity:** Critical operations stay current
- **Automated Recovery:** Daily healing of any missed updates
- **Predictable Load:** Consistent processing windows
- **User Experience:** Fresh data for daily operations

#### ❌ **NEGATIVES**
- **High Resource Usage:** Daily compute and database load
- **Complexity Management:** 365 potential failure points per year
- **Cost Impact:** Higher infrastructure costs (~$200-300/month)
- **Operational Overhead:** Daily monitoring and alert management
- **Error Accumulation:** Daily failures could compound

#### **Best For:** High-frequency trading, real-time analytics, mission-critical operations

---

### Option 2: 🗓️ **WEEKLY SYNCHRONIZATION**

#### Implementation Approach
- **Schedule:** Every Sunday at 1:00 AM (weekend low-traffic)
- **Method:** Weekly batch processing with comprehensive validation
- **Architecture:** Full delta scan → Bulk processing → Relationship validation

#### Technical Implementation
```typescript
// Weekly sync scheduler
interface WeeklySyncConfig {
  schedule: "0 1 * * 0" // 1 AM Sundays
  batchSize: 5000
  timeoutMs: 14400000 // 4 hours max
  validationEnabled: true
  fullIntegrityCheck: true
}
```

#### ✅ **POSITIVES**
- **Optimal Balance:** Good freshness vs. resource efficiency
- **Comprehensive Validation:** Time for thorough integrity checks
- **Lower Costs:** ~70% less infrastructure cost than daily
- **Reduced Complexity:** 52 sync operations per year vs. 365
- **Weekend Processing:** Minimal business disruption
- **Recovery Time:** Sufficient time for error resolution

#### ❌ **NEGATIVES**
- **Weekly Latency:** Up to 7-day delay for some updates
- **Larger Batch Sizes:** More complex error recovery
- **Business Impact:** Week-old data for some operations
- **Weekend Dependencies:** Support coverage during sync windows

#### **Best For:** Standard business operations, reporting systems, non-critical updates

---

### Option 3: 🎯 **ON-DEMAND SYNCHRONIZATION**

#### Implementation Approach
- **Trigger:** Manual execution or event-driven (API calls)
- **Method:** Selective sync based on business needs
- **Architecture:** Event detection → Targeted processing → Validation

#### Technical Implementation
```typescript
// On-demand sync system
interface OnDemandSyncConfig {
  triggers: ["manual", "api", "webhook"]
  selectiveSync: {
    entities: string[]
    dateRange?: [Date, Date]
    priorities: ["critical", "normal", "low"]
  }
  maxConcurrentJobs: 3
}
```

#### ✅ **POSITIVES**
- **Cost Efficiency:** Only pay for processing when needed
- **Flexible Timing:** Sync during optimal business windows
- **Selective Processing:** Focus on critical data only
- **Zero Waste:** No unnecessary processing of unchanged data
- **Control:** Complete business control over sync timing
- **Resource Optimization:** Burst capacity during high-need periods

#### ❌ **NEGATIVES**
- **Manual Overhead:** Requires human decision-making
- **Inconsistent Data:** Unpredictable staleness
- **Business Risk:** Critical updates might be delayed
- **Process Complexity:** Requires sophisticated change detection
- **Staff Training:** Team needs sync management expertise
- **Potential Gaps:** Risk of missing important updates

#### **Best For:** Seasonal businesses, project-based work, cost-sensitive operations
