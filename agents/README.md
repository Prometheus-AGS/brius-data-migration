# Database Migration Agent System

A multi-agent system built on the Mastra framework for intelligent database migration and design assistance. This system guides users through complex PostgreSQL schema migrations and data transformations without requiring deep database expertise.

## Overview

This agent system automates the complete database migration lifecycle:
- **Discovery**: Analyzes source and target schemas
- **Planning**: Creates migration strategies with dependency resolution
- **Execution**: Performs batch migrations with error recovery
- **Validation**: Ensures data integrity and completeness
- **Guidance**: Provides user-friendly explanations and recommendations

## Architecture

### Core Agents

| [Orchestrator](specs/orchestrator-agent.md) | Master workflow controller | Coordinate agents, manage state, handle errors |
| [Schema Analysis](specs/schema-analysis-agent.md) | Database introspection | Analyze schemas, detect relationships, profile data |
| [Planning](specs/planning-agent.md) | Migration strategy | Create dependency-aware plans, batch sizing, risk assessment |
| [Data Mapping](specs/data-mapping-agent.md) | Field transformation | Define mappings, handle type conversions, maintain traceability |

| [Validation](specs/validation-agent.md) | Data integrity | Verify counts, check constraints, validate completeness |
| [User Guidance](specs/user-guidance-agent.md) | User interface | Translate technical concepts, provide recommendations |

## Key Features

### Battle-Tested Patterns

- Handles complex relationship discovery and dependency resolution
- Supports catalog/reference data and transactional data patterns

### Robust Error Handling
- Graceful failure recovery with detailed error reporting
- Rollback capabilities with transaction safety
- Resume interrupted migrations from last successful checkpoint

### User-Friendly Interface
- Non-technical language for business users
- Clear progress reporting with concrete metrics
- Risk assessment and recommendation system

### Comprehensive Tracking

```

## Quick Start

1. **Review Architecture**: Start with [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md)
2. **Understand Workflows**: Read [workflows/discovery-workflow.md](workflows/discovery-workflow.md)
3. **Examine Agent Specs**: Study individual agent specifications in `specs/`
4. **See Examples**: Check real-world examples in `examples/`
5. **Implement**: Follow [examples/mastra-integration.md](examples/mastra-integration.md)

## Based on Real Experience

This system is designed from successful migrations including:
- **Brackets Migration**: 1,569 catalog records migrated as reference data
- **Junction Tables**: Complex many-to-many relationships (case_file_relationships)
- **Schema Evolution**: INTEGER→UUID transformations, metadata additions
- **Error Recovery**: Constraint violations, missing relationships, orphaned data

## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Mastra (agent orchestration, workflows, memory)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (source and target)
- **Language**: Node.js/TypeScript
- **Deployment**: Serverless-ready (Vercel, Cloudflare Workers)

## Development Status

- ✅ Architecture designed
- ✅ Agent specifications defined
- ✅ Workflow patterns documented
- ⏳ Mastra implementation (next phase)
- ⏳ Testing with known scenarios
- ⏳ Production deployment

*Built with experience from complex PostgreSQL migrations and powered by the Mastra framework.*

## Tools Integration

### Code Interpreter Tool
The migration agents include a powerful **Code Interpreter Tool** that provides secure, containerized execution of dynamically generated TypeScript code:

- **Secure Execution**: Docker-based sandboxing with resource limits and network controls
- **Dynamic Code Generation**: Template-based migration script creation
- **Environment Isolation**: Each execution runs in a clean, isolated container
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Structured output parsing and error handling

See [tools/code-interpreter-tool.md](tools/code-interpreter-tool.md) for detailed implementation.

### Updated Tool Stack

| Tool | Purpose | Security Features |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| [Code Interpreter](tools/code-interpreter-tool.md) | Execute generated TypeScript migration code | Container isolation, resource limits, network controls |
| [Postgres Connector](../examples/mastra-integration.md) | Database connectivity with Supabase integration | Service role authentication, RLS policy compliance |
| [Schema Introspector](specs/schema-analysis-agent.md) | Database schema analysis and profiling | Read-only operations, connection pooling |
| [Batch Processor](specs/migration-execution-agent.md) | Efficient data processing and transformation | Memory optimization, progress tracking |

## Enhanced Capabilities

With the Code Interpreter Tool integration, the migration agents can now:

1. **Dynamic Script Generation**: Create migration scripts tailored to specific table types and transformation requirements
2. **Safe Execution**: Run complex migration logic in isolated containers with automatic cleanup
3. **Real-time Monitoring**: Track execution time, memory usage, and progress in real-time
4. **Error Recovery**: Parse execution errors and provide actionable suggestions for resolution
5. **Audit Compliance**: Maintain complete logs of all generated and executed code

## Security Enhancements

- **Container Isolation**: Each migration runs in a separate Docker container
- **Resource Limits**: CPU (1.0), Memory (512MB), Timeout (5 minutes)
- **Network Controls**: Selective network access based on migration requirements
- **Non-root Execution**: All code runs as non-privileged user (1000:1000)
- **Read-only Filesystem**: Containers use read-only root filesystem with limited tmpfs
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Complete cleanup of containers and temporary files after execution

## Real-World Case Studies
